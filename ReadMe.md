# LUNG CANCER PREDICTION INSIDE CONTAINERS 🐋

Hello guys! Back with another article. In this article i will go through how we can train machine learning models inside containers. For containers technology i will be using docker.

# Why Docker 🐋🐋 ??

Because Docker containers encapsulate everything an application needs to run (and only those things), they allow applications to be shuttled easily between environments. Any host with the Docker runtime installed — be it a developer’s laptop or a public cloud instance — can run a Docker container.
In this article, i will be using lung cancer dataset. This would be classification problem. On the given inputs the prediction will be a particular guys whether he is affected with lung cancer or not.
